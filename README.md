Week 3: Database Querying & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 Dataset Used

For this assignment, I used the Titanic Survival Dataset
 from Kaggle.
This dataset contains passenger details, including age, sex, ticket class, and whether they survived.

 Data Cleaning

Removed missing/null values in the Age and Embarked columns.

Converted categorical features (Sex, Embarked) into numeric form for analysis.

Standardized column names for readability.

 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights from the dataset:

Most passengers were in 3rd class, but the survival rate was highest in 1st class.

Females had a higher survival rate than males.

Younger passengers (children) had a higher chance of survival.

The Fare distribution was skewed, with a few costly tickets.

 Visualizations

Bar chart of survival rate by gender.

Histogram of passenger ages.

Boxplot of fare vs. passenger class.

 #Conclusion

The Titanic dataset shows that gender, age, and passenger class were strong indicators of survival chances.






##  Discussion
This assignment was part of the ML Cohort program (Week 3).  
I explored the Titanic dataset using Python, performed data cleaning, and conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
The insights revealed how age, gender, and passenger class influenced survival chances.  

I welcome feedback and suggestions to improve my analysis
